Based on [MariaSolOs nvim dotfiles](https://github.com/MariaSolOs/dotfiles/tree/main/.config/nvim).
Requires nvim v0.11 or higher.

## Notes

starting from neovim 0.11 the `lspconfig` plugin is not required. Lsp server are automatically loaded
from `./lsp` folder
- to check LSP status (similar to LspInfo command): `checkhealth vim.lsp`
